# 1. Write a function to split a given string on hyphens (-) and display each substring on a new line.
# You must:


def new_sentence(a):
    sentence = a.split('-')
    for i in sentence:
        print(i)
    
new_sentence("Emma-is-a-data-scientist")



# 2. Write a Python program to reverse a given string in two ways:
 
#without slicing

def reverse (a):
    new = ""
    for i in a:
        new = i+new
    print(new)
reverse("python")

# with slicing

def reverse(a):
    new = a[::-1]
    print(new)

reverse("Python")


# 3. Write a Python program to count the number of consonants in a given string.
 

def find_consonants(c):
    count = 0
    for j in c:
        if j != "e" and j != "a" and j != "i" and j != "o" and j != "u" and j != " " :
            count = count+1
    print("the total number of consonants is :",count)
            
find_consonants("Hello World")



# 4.  Write a Python program to remove all spaces from a given string.
 


def remove_space(a):
    new = ""
    for i in a:
        if i != " ":
            new = new+i
    print(new)
        
remove_space(" Python is awesome")


# 5. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a password and checks if it is strong. A password is considered strong if:


def password_check():
    special_char = "@#$%^&*"
    password = input("Enter the Password :")
    if len(password)>=8:
        if any(char in special_char for char in password):
            return "Your password is strong"
        else:
            return "Your password is not strong"
    else:
        return "Password must be contain atleast 8 characters"
print(password_check())
